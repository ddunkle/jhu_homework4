## Purpose

This project tied in HTML, CSS, and JS to manipulate the DOM. The purpose was to create a quiz, have the user complete the quiz, and store the results. As intended, I believe this assignment was supposed to focus on vanilla javascript, however, I completed it use jQuery as that is what I felt more comfortable doing and knew I had a better chance at success.

This assigment was significantly more involved than the previous assignment, and the most complex one we have had to date. If I were to change some things, I would first focus more on using vanilla js rather than jQuery. I would also figure out how to sort the high score results in decending order. Finally, while functional, I would clean up some of the CSS and make it more reactive for different sized screens.
